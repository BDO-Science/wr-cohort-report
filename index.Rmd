# About

We summarize environmental and habitat conditions in 2021 and assess the 2021 brood year of Sacramento winter-run Chinook salmon (WRCS; _Oncorhynchus tshawytscha_) (**BY 2021**). We used data available online to generate this report. This report follows the format of the BY 2019 WRCS Report written by Anchor QEA (@ref(https://www.anchorqea.com/news/brood-year-2019-winter-run-chinook-salmon-operations-and-monitoring-assessment/)). The assessment was in collaboration with the `Sacramento River Science Partnership`.

## Render book

You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything:

1. Find the **Build** pane in the RStudio IDE, and

1. Click on **Build Book**, then select your output format, or select "All formats" if you'd like to use multiple formats from the same book source files.

Or build the book from the R console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bookdown::render_book()
```

To render this example to PDF as a `bookdown::pdf_book`, you'll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.org/tinytex/>.

## Preview book

As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in "Preview book", or from the R console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
bookdown::serve_book()
```


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
