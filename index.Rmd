# About

We summarize environmental and habitat conditions in 2021 and assess the 2021 brood year of Sacramento winter-run Chinook salmon (WRCS; _Oncorhynchus tshawytscha_) (**BY 2021**). We used data available online to generate this report. This report follows the format of the BY 2019 WRCS Report written by Anchor QEA (\@ref(https://www.anchorqea.com/news/brood-year-2019-winter-run-chinook-salmon-operations-and-monitoring-assessment/)). The assessment was in collaboration with the `Sacramento River Science Partnership`.
