We used data available online to generate this report. This report follows the format of the BY 2019 WRCS Report written by Anchor QEA (@ref(https://www.anchorqea.com/news/brood-year-2019-winter-run-chinook-salmon-operations-and-monitoring-assessment/)). The assessment was in collaboration with the Sacramento River Science Partnership. 1.1 WR Chinook Salmon Life History Sacramento River WRCS begin their spawning migration in November, traveling from the San Francisco Bay to the upper Sacramento River, and spawning between mid-April to August. Juvenile WRCS emigrate downstream between July-March, and are present in the Delta between September-June. 1.2 WR Chinook Salmon Threats WRCS historically spawned in cold-water reaches of the McCloud, Pit, and Sacramento Rivers. The construction of Shasta and Keswick Dams blocked WRCS from returning to the cooler spawning grounds, and the population is now limited to spawning below Keswick Dam, which experiences higher water temperatures and lower flows. WRCS were listed under the California Endangered Species Act (CESA) in 1989, and were listed under the Federal Endangered Species Act as endangered on January 4, 1994. 1.3 Spatial Distribution “distribution map” 1.4 Conceptual Model Metrics selected in this report are based on a conceptual model developed by Windell et al. (2017). “conceptual model” 1.5 References https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Fishes/Chinook-Salmon/Winter-run Moyle P.B. 2002.

Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. Add a numbered part: # (PART) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an unnumbered part: # (PART\\*) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: # (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-} (followed by # A chapter). Chapters in an appendix are prepended with letters instead of numbers. 8.2 Footnotes and citations 8.2.1 Footnotes Footnotes are put inside the square brackets after a caret ^[]. Like this one 1. 8.2.2 Citations Reference items in your bibliography file(s) using @key. For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2023) (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015) (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the .bib files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML bibliography key. The RStudio Visual Markdown Editor can also make it easier to insert citations: https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/#/citations 8.3 Blocks 8.3.1 Equations Here is an equation. \\[\\begin{equation} f\\left(k\\right) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k\\left(1-p\\right)^{n-k} \\tag{8.1} \\end{equation}\\] You may refer to using \\@ref(eq:binom), like see Equation (8.1). 8.3.2 Theorems and proofs Labeled theorems can be referenced in text using \\@ref(thm:tri), for example, check out this smart theorem 8.1. Theorem 8.1 For a right triangle, if \\(c\\) denotes the length of the hypotenuse and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) denote the lengths of the other two sides, we have \\[a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\] Read more here https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-extensions-by-bookdown.html. 8.3.3 Callout blocks The R Markdown Cookbook provides more help on how to use custom blocks to design your own callouts: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/custom-blocks.html 8.4 Cross-references Cross-references make it easier for your readers to find and link to elements in your book. 8.4.1 Chapters and sub-chapters There are two steps to cross-reference any heading: Label the heading: # Hello world {#nice-label}. Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 8.4. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 8.4.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively. See Figure 8.1. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 8.1: Here is a nice figure!

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 8.5.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file. Read more about the features of this output format here: https://pkgs.rstudio.com/bookdown/reference/gitbook.html Or use: ?bookdown::gitbook 8.6 Render book You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything: Find the Build pane in the RStudio IDE, and Click on Build Book, then select your output format, or select “All formats” if you’d like to use multiple formats from the same book source files. Or build the book from the R console: bookdown::render_book() To render this example to PDF as a bookdown::pdf_book, you’ll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/. 8.7 Preview book As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in “Preview book”, or from the R console: bookdown::serve_book() 8.8 Footnotes and citations 8.8.1 Footnotes Footnotes are put inside the square brackets after a caret ^[].
