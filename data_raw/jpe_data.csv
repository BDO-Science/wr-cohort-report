Survival is estimated from the Salt Creek receiver site, located 3 miles downstream of RBDD, to estimate survival from RBDD for acoustic tag studies (See Appendix A, for further description of how the weighted average acoustic tag survival was used for methods 2, 2a,3 and 3a). This is the derivation of the numbers of fish arriving to Salt Ck (RBDD) and Sacramento (Tower, Sac180/50) from the acoustic tagged LSNFH winter run pre-smolts. The number of fish arriving to Salt Ck and Sac 180/50 are derived by looking at receivers at this location and all locations downstream. It uses fish directly detected at that site plus any fish that were missed at that site but detected at a site downstream. This was done for all years 2013-2017. The 2017 year was the only year that had significant flows over Fremont Weir. Fish that went over the weir and into the Yolo Bypass would bypass the Sacramento 180/50 Bridge and other nearby receiver locations. If these fish were detected at locations downstream of Liberty Island they were considered to have survived to the Delta and thus added to the number of the fish counted at Sacramento 180/50 Bridge.",NA,NA,NA
