# Egg to Fry Emergence

This section describes environmental attributes associated with and responses during the egg-to-fry life stage.

## Habitat Attributes 

1. Redd Dewatering
  * count by year
  * location
  * water depth
  * flow

## Environmental Drivers

1. Air Temperature

2. DO

3. Shasta Storage/Hydrology

4. Water Temperature

## Biological Response

1. Egg Count

* line plot of potential eggs by year with averages (JPE letter?)

2. Egg to fry survival 

* bar plot of percent survival by year (JPI calculation)
  * JPI = fry abundance/total viable eggs in JPE letter
* egg to fry survival by number of mainstem in-river spawners (JPI calculation)
* egg-to-fry survival from fish model (fish model)

3. Emergence Timing (fish model)
